This is the Implementation Guide (IG) for recording the stress management details in pregnant women.
Managing stress during pregnancy is essential for the well-being of both the mother and the baby. Chronic stress can negatively impact the mother’s mental health and the baby’s development. 

This FHIR IG (related files) illustrates the data modeling and mappings of real data elements to FHIR elements and can serve as an example for future IG implementations.
To construct the IG, you should use SUSHI and the IG publisher (use: _genonce).
